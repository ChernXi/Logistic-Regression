# Logistic-Regression

Logistic Regression model is mainly for binary classification.<br>
Logistic Regression model is not just another model to use, but when you apply it correctly, it can outperform even the much complicated dense neural network. <br>
Before we dig into it, I will show you an example where it is best to use to Logistic Regression: The Titanic survival prediction model <br>
If you use a multinomial regression model, you can basically get an accuracy around 74%. <br>
If you use a dense neural network model, you can enhance the accuracy to 82%. (By consider the deeper relation between the basics attribute.) <br>
Guess what is the accuracy we get by using a Logistic Regression model? We can make it to 95%!!!<br> 
To see how it was done, you can take a look on my code here.<br>
