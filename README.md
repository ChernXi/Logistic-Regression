# Logistic-Regression

The logistic regression model is mainly used for binary classification. <br>
The logistic regression model is not just another model to use, but when you apply it correctly, it can outperform even the much more complicated dense neural network. <br>
Before we dig into it, I will show you an example where it is best to use Logistic Regression: The Titanic survival prediction model <br>
If you use a multinomial regression model, you can basically get an accuracy of around 74%. <br>
If you use a dense neural network model, you can enhance the accuracy to 82%. (By considering the deeper relationship between the basic attributes.) <br>
Guess what accuracy we get by using a Logistic Regression model? We can make it to 95%!!! <br>
To see how it was done, you can take a look at [Titanic Survival Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/ChernXi/Logistic-Regression/blob/e77cb08ead4a2f091c353d5fb0c33aa84f85ea42/Titanic%20Survival%20Logistic%20Regression%20Model.ipynb). <br>
